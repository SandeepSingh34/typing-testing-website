    "April 2021. Everyday, my country, India, is touching new heights in the number of Covid19 cases. Every day, more and more people are dying. Every day, we are hearing that someone we know has been infected. After one year, we are back in square one, that too a grimmer one. How did we reach here?",
   "I had always wondered why it is a ritual in our society that a woman goes to her motherâ€™s home to deliver her child. When I was pregnant with my daughter last year and once she was born in the first month of this year, I got my answers. The reason is the mother of the new mother, the new grandmother. And the truth that nobody can take care of you better than your own mother, especially when you are with child and after childbirth.",
   "Short moral stories are best for children who have been reading for generations. These short stories with morals are popular in different languages and parts of the world. A moral story depicts practical situations excitingly and carries a message that imbibes moral values in the children. Different short moral stories teach different lessons to kids. The stories also make children responsible, respectful, empathetic, and honest from a very early age."
